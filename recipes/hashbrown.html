    <p>Learn how to make hash browns that taste just like McDonald's. 
        They are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. These are the recipes
        and directions, which are very easy to follow.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Potato flour</li>
        <li>Rice flour</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Onion powder</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Soak the potatoes. Grate potatoes using a cheese grater, then transfer them to a bowl of cold water and let them sit for 20 minutes. Drain the water and squeeze out as much moisture as possible.</li>
        <li>Cook the potatoes. Add butter to a skillet over medium heat. Add the shredded potatoes and cook for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine ingredients. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl to cool. Once cool, add the remaining ingredients until a thick dough remains. If the dough is too thick, add a splash of more water.</li>
        <li>Shape. Using your hands, shape the mixture into rectangular hash browns. Transfer them to a lined plate and refrigerate for at least two hours.</li>
        <li>Fry. Add an inch of oil to a deep pan over medium high heat. Once hot, add the chilled hash browns and cook for 2-3 minutes, then flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes until golden.</li>
        <li>Drain and serve. Let the hash browns cool on a wire rack to remove excess oil and dry crumbs before serving.</li>
      </ol>
